## **Introduction**
### **Overview**

Understanding internet penetration within communities is crucial for equitable development, yet Togo lacks comprehensive data on connectivity demand in households, hospitals, and schools. Accurate insights are essential for effective policymaking and resource allocation, and machine learning can predict internet usage patterns to bridge data gaps.

By addressing socio-economic challenges, this project will drive sustainable development in Togo, enabling better policies and infrastructure investments, and narrowing the digital divide. Identifying institutions that need internet access will enhance healthcare and education, fostering a more connected, empowered, and inclusive society.



### **Togo's Digital Transformation**
Togo is committed to modernizing its economy, aiming to become a hub for business and innovation by 2025 through the 'Strat√©gie Togo Digital 2025'. This strategy integrates digital projects into a coherent plan, focusing on e-government, digital identity, and regional planning.

The Ministry of the Digital Economy and Transformation is leading this effort, promoting digital development in areas such as entrepreneurship, infrastructure, innovation, broadband internet, and telecommunications. Key projects like e-ID Togo and digital regional planning have driven significant progress, resulting in high fixed and mobile internet penetration rates.

To support the Togo Digital 2025 strategy, the Agence Togo Digital (ATD) assists the government in its digitization efforts and aims to digitize 75% of administrative procedures, working with the private sector and government departments to achieve this goal.

### **Objectives**
This project aims to develop a machine learning solution to predict FTTH internet uptake in Togo using socio-demographic and geographic datasets. The goal is to create accurate models to help the government improve connectivity, allocate resources efficiently, and foster digital inclusivity.
