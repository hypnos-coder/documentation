### Model Maintenance Guidelines

Preparing for deployment on Heroku involves proactive maintenance strategies:

- **Regular Updates**: Scheduled retraining of models with new data to adapt to evolving patterns.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Utilizing monitoring solutions to track model performance metrics (e.g., response time, accuracy) and detect anomalies.

- **Version Control**: Maintaining model version control for reproducibility and rollback capabilities.

For detailed insights into our model maintenance practices as we integrate with Django API and deploy on Heroku, refer to our maintenance documentation.

## Deployment Planning

### Integration Planning for Heroku Platform with Django API

In preparation for deployment on Heroku via Django API, considerations include:

- **API Design**: Designing endpoints for seamless integration of model inference with Django framework.

- **Serialization**: Implementing serialization techniques to facilitate data exchange between API and model components.

- **Scalability**: Ensuring API architecture supports scalable and efficient model serving under varying loads.
